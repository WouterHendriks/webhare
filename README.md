# WebHare
Helpful scripts go here. 

For now, we just have an 'install-webhare.sh' Bash script that will install WebHare on Macs. 

This script assumes the following:

- you are using a Mac
- your public key is added for the WebHare Git repository on Gitlab
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is installed and up-to-date
- `brew doctor` gives a clean result
- Node.JS is installed using Homebrew (`brew install node`)
